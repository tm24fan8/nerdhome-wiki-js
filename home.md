# Welcome

This is the home page for our household wiki. It will eventually be where the Home Assistant instructions are posted and updated, as well as other useful information.

For now though, you can still access the Home Assistant instructions at the GitHub wiki [here](https://github.com/tm24fan8/Home-Assistant-Configs/wiki). This will be migrated as I find the time to do so.

I am currently testing the ability to use GitHub to sync this wiki so that I can edit with VS Code instead of the shitty visual editor in Wiki.js
