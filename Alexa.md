# Useful Alexa Commands

- ***"Alexa, good morning"*** will give you a nice morning briefing to start your day.
- ***"Alexa, weather briefing"*** will give you just the weather briefing instead of the entire morning briefing.
- ***"Alexa, give me darkness"*** will darken the house except for some strategically placed nightlight scenes. This is mainly for use after kids bedtimes.
- ***"Alexa, good night"*** turns off all lights except upstairs bathroom nightlight, and sets all Echo Dots to Do Not Disturb mode.
- ***"Alexa, basement on"*** turns on the basement studio lights, Tony's computer, the basement TV, and optionally Kallen's computer (it will ask you whether you want to do this, just say yes or no).

## Lighting

You can call for lights on or off by saying "{name of room} lights on/off"
Example: "Alexa, living room lights on"

If you are in a room with an Echo Dot, and you want to control the lights in that same room, all you have to say is "Alexa, lights on" or "Alexa, lights off" and it will only change that room.

You can call scenes by saying "Alexa, turn on {scene} in {room}". There are some housewide/floorwide/multiroom scenes. There is a general list of scenes [here](https://github.com/tm24fan8/Home-Assistant-Configs/wiki/Lights#scenes)
